# Old documentation

The documentation hosted on this website matches the latest release.
Check the footer to see what version is currently displayed.

While it's better to keep your dependencies up-to-date, you can display an old version of the documentation. To do so:

1. Install [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)
2. Clone the MaterialValues [repository](https://github.com/AoDevBlue/MaterialValues)
3. Checkout one of the version tags
4. Serve the documentation locally with `mkdocs serve`
5. Connect to it with your browser
